    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>I am an Optometrist with over 5 years of experience in providing comprehensive eye care,
    diagnosing visual conditions, and recommending treatment plans to patient. Currently I am pursuing my degree
    in Information Technology with a strong ambition to transition into web development. Throughout my career as an
    Optometrist, I have developed skills such as problem solving, attention to detail, and communication with growing
    proficiency in HTML, CSS, Javascript to create a responsive web design. I am eager to leverage my analytical skills from
    healthcare practice to build efficient, user-centric websites and applications while continuing to expand my knowledge in
    modern web technologies and software development. I am passionate to combine healthcare with tech innovation.
